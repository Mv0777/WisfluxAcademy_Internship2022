TYPESCRIPT TASK

Description:In this assignment you have to animate three different images using html and JavaScript
in a sequential order with the same animation style with `promises`.Todo:-Create A HTML file with 
all necessary code and three different images (use any image you want).-Embed your JavaScript file 
into this html and use the ` animate()` method of DOM toanimate the images before that you need to
 create your own animation(ex-Rotation, Scaling, etc.).-The Sequence of animation must be Linear 
 it means the first image will be animate first, then the second and the third one.-Use the Promise
  chaining or await/async approach.
 Note: The animate() function returns an AnimationObject,
   this object has a `finished` property, which is a Promise
   Reference JavaScript code:
    <script>
   const animation= [
    {transform: 'rotate (0) scale (1)'},
    ]
   const animationConfig= {
    duration: 2000,
    iterations: 1,
    fill: 'forwards'}
   const image = document.querySelector("#image-id");
   image.animate(animation,animationConfig)
    </script>
